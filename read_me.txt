Project : This project is about the use of two known technologies "YOLO Application" and Intel RealSense
	  Camera. In this project, we are associating both of these technologies together to be able to
          detect pedestrian(s) and detect their distance from a given depth camera.
	  The final application would be available to be mounted on an autonomous car.


Warning : There might exist some path issues into the project. If a file does not open : right click -> properties 
          If the path does begin with "\\?", please copy the file into another path of your computer and you should
	  be able to open it. This issue is due to the transfer of the project from two different OS (Windows - Ubuntu)


Any issues, contact me by e-mail.
